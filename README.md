# readline-js #
**readline-js** is a jQuery-based framework for emacs/readline-like
line editing commands. Future additions will include history and tab
completion, just like a real readline library.

# Using It #
Using readline-js is simple. Include the appropriate scripts in your
HTML document, and use the `readline` function on anything. **Only one
thing should be `readline`'d at a time or weird things could happen.**

Use of the readline function looks something like this:

```js
$('#my_text_entry').readline('myprompt> ', function(line) {
  alert('Line: ' + line);
});
```

The prompt argument is optional. If omitted, no prompt will be added to
the element. Note that all keypresses in the document will be sent to
the element.

## The HTML ##
readline-js adjusts the content HTML of the entry element. The prompt
will be contained within a `<span>` with the class `prompt`, and the
character under the cursor will be contained within a `<span>` with the
class `cursor`. The cursor `<span>` will also have any of the `ctrl` or
`shift` classes, depending on whether the corresponding modifiers are
being held down. This can be used to alter the appearance of the cursor
based on the status of the modifier keys.

# Limitations and Quirks #
* Currently, only one element on the page may be used for text entry.
  This is a side effect of the focus model.
* All key events on the page are handled by readline-js (unless
  `readline()` was never used). This is because the `keydown` and `keyup`
  event handlers are attached to the `<body>` tag.
